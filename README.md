# FMCG Supply Chain Optimization Dashboard

An interactive Microsoft Excel dashboard designed to optimize FMCG supply chains by analyzing demand, supply, and warehouse performance across regions. This project follows the **six-stage data analysis process** to provide actionable insights and drive data-driven decisions.

---

## 1. Ask (Problem Definition)
Supply chain teams in the FMCG sector face challenges in monitoring demand, supply, and warehouse performance across multiple regions. Key questions addressed in this project:
- Are we meeting total demand across regions?
- Where are supply gaps and overstock/understock risks?
- Which warehouses are at high risk due to operational or environmental issues?
- How does retail coverage and competitor presence vary by warehouse?

---

## 2. Prepare (Data Collection & Cleaning)
- Collected historical demand and supply data from all warehouses
- Aggregated warehouse distribution, staff, and distance metrics
- Compiled critical issues such as electricity outages and flood impact
- Cleaned and formatted raw data for analysis in Excel

---

## 3. Process (Data Transformation)
- Applied pivot tables for aggregations and comparisons
- Calculated supply gaps (Demand - Supply) by region and warehouse
- Flagged overstock and understock situations
- Categorized warehouse risk levels and staff adequacy
- Transformed raw numbers into interactive metrics and visualizations


## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**
- **PivotTables**
- **Data Transformation & Cleaning**

## 4. Analyze (Insights & Metrics)
The dashboard provides detailed insights through interactive visuals:

### Key Metrics
